               <h2> G80 </h2>

            <p>The M3 version of the E46 3 Series was produced in coupé and
                 convertible body styles. The E46 M3 is powered by the S54 straight-six engine
                  and has a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 5.1 seconds for the coupé, with 
                  either the manual or SMG-II transmission.[63][64] The skidpad cornering results are 
                  0.89 g for the coupé and 0.81 g for the convertible.[65][66] The top speed is electronically 
                  limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).[64] The kerb weight is 1,570 kg (3,461 lb).

            <p> The available transmissions were a Getrag 420G 6-speed manual transmission or a SMG-II 
                6-speed automated manual transmission,which was based on the Getrag 420G.[67] The SMG-II used an electrohydraulically actuated 
                 clutch, and gear shifts could be selected via the shift lever or paddles mounted on the 
                 steering wheel. The SMG-II was praised for its fast shift times and racetrack performance, 
                 but some people found its shifts to be delayed and lurching in stop-start traffic</p>
