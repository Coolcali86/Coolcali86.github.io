           <p>The <strong>M3</strong> version of the E46 3 Series was produced in coupÃ© and
                convertible body styles.<strong>The E46 M3</strong> is powered by the S54 straight-six engine
                 and has a <strong> 0-100 km/h (62 mph)acceleration</strong> time of <strong>5.1 seconds</strong> for the coupÃ©,ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±
               ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯, with 
                 either the manual or SMG-II transmission.[63][64] The skidpad cornering results are 
                 0.89 g for the coupÃ© and 0.81 g for the convertible.[65][66] The top speed is electronically 
                 limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).[64] The kerb weight is 1,570 kg (3,461 lb).

           <p> The available transmissions were a Getrag 420G <strong>6-speed manual</strong> transmission or a SMG-II 
               6-speed automated manual transmission,which was based on the Getrag 420G.[67] The SMG-II used an electrohydraulically actuated 
                clutch, and gear shifts could be selected via the shift lever or paddles mounted on the 
                steering wheel. The SMG-II was praised for its fast shift times and racetrack performance, 
                but some people found its shifts to be delayed and lurching in stop-start traffic</p>

          <p>The E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four-cylinder engine, a high-revving DOHC design with a head closely based on that of the BMW S38 six-cylinder engine and the block from the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine with a 7,250 rpm redline.[10][12] In countries where the M3 was sold with a catalytic converter, the initial versions were rated at 143 kW (195 PS; 192 hp) and had a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph).[13] In countries where a catalytic converter was not fitted, the engine was rated at 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp).</p>
