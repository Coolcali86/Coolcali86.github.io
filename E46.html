            <p>The Aston Martin DB7 is a<strong> grand tourer</strong> which was produced by British lesquery automobili
              manufacturer <strong>Aston Martin</strong> from September 1994 to December 2004. The car was available either 
              as a coupÃ© or a convertible. The prototype was complete by November 1992 and debuted at the Geneva
               Motor Show in March, 1993; the car was designed by Ian Callum and Keith Helfet. The six-cylinder
                DB7 (based on the Jaguar AJ6 engine) was positioned as an "entry-level" model below the hand-built 
                V8 Virage introduced a few years earlier. This model was the highest produced Aston Martin automobile
                 ever, with more than 7,000 built before it was replaced by the DB9 in 2004.

            <p>The DB7, known internally as the XX project, was made mostly wi
              th resources from Jaguar Cars and had the financial backing of the 
              Ford Motor Company, owner of Aston Martin from 1988 to 2007. The DB7's
               platform is an evolution of the Jaguar XJS platform, though with many changes. </p>
          
               <p>The DB7 began life as a successor to the <strong>Jaguar XJS</strong> 
                 envisioned by Tom Walkinshaw of TWR. Walkinshaw had been
                  impressed by the XJS' potential after driving it in the European T
                  ouring Car Championship in the late 1970s and early 1980s and wanted
                   to re-body the car so it would have more modern styling. He initially w
                   anted to engage Peter Stevens to design such a car but he refused due 
                   to his on going projects at the time. Walkinshaw then engaged Ian Callum, 
                   who was new in the car design work at the time, to design the car. </p>
